                        This video demonstrates the Duckiebot's ability to drive in a straight line for a distance of 2 meters. Achieving this behavior required extensive motor calibration to ensure that both motors operated at consistent speeds. Despite multiple adjustments to the calibration parameters, the Duckiebot kept on going right right.

                        After an hour of tuning,  the Duckiebot suddenly drove straight, demonstrating that robots can sometimes behave unpredictably. The deviation was likely caused by slight discrepancies in motor performance.

                        This video shows the Duckiebot completing 2 rounds of lane-following demo, where it follows the road on auto-pilot. Often times, the robot had difficulty staying in the lane, especially at turns. This could be due to small errors in camera calibration, delays in motor response, or difficulty detecting the lane in certain lighting conditions. This highlights the importance of proper wheels and camera calibrations.

                        The Duckiebot follows the lane by using its camera to see the road and find the lane markings, like the yellow line in the center or the white lines on the sides. It looks at where it is on the road and adjusts its direction if it starts drifting off the lane. The robot keeps checking and making small movements to stay in the lane.

                        The intrinsics calibration is essential for correcting camera distortions, ensuring that the camera accurately perceives the real world. This calibration process determines the camera's internal parameters, such as focal length and lens distortion coefficients.

                        We performed the intrinsics calibration by moving the camera in various angles and distances capturing checkerboard pattern from different prespectives. This ensures that the calibration accurately accounts for the camera's field of view and distortion.Accurate intrinsics calibration is important for reliable lane detection and object recognition in robotics.

                        The extrinsics calibration ensures the robot understands the camera’s position and angle relative to its body. This is essential for accurate lane-following and object detection, as it allows the robot to interpret what the camera sees in relation to its surroundings.

                        In this assignment, we tested various aspects of the Duckiebot to ensure its readiness for future tasks. We calibrated the motor and intrinsic and extrinsic cameras, tested the Duckiebot’s lane-following and straight-line driving capabilities, and made sure our bot was connected to the system.</p>
                        <p>
                        Through this process, I learned the purpose of different calibrations, such as camera and motor calibration, and the importance of precise adjustments for reliable robot performance.  I also learned how the smallest thing can impact the robot's behavior greatly. One major challenge was ensuring the Duckiebot drove straight, consistently veering to one side despite adjustments. This process taught me to be patient with the robot and also how unpredictable robots can be.

                       This lab exercise gave me a basic understanding of how robots operate. It was interesting to observe how the Duckiebot's behavior could be unpredictable at times and even a small change in setup can impact it's motion a lot. It made me understand how working with robots require so much care and attention to smallest details which made me appreciate robotics and the precision it demands.
